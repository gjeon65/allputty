Lab2: File I/O Programming

Description:

In this assignment, you will write a program to the following
specifications, using C file system calls.

Given two directories ./a and ./b, passed as parameters to your program, you
need to synchronize them, as follows:

if a file in a does not exist in directory b, you should replicate it in
directory b.

if a file in b does not exist in directory a, it should be deleted from
directory b.

if a file exists in both directories a and b, the file with the most recent
modified date /time should be copied from one directory to the other.



Print a log of your program's activities to stdout or stderr
